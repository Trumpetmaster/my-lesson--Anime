**This will format bold**

For example:

**TODO 1 :** Here, create two variables in the same statement, one named `prompt` which will hold the prompt module, and one named `fs` to hold the file-system module:

This is how you format code:

#!/usr/bin/env node

// TODO 1 : create variables for prompt and fs by calling require in each respective module:
